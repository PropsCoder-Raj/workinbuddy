    <p>It all started when Jijulal (JC) visited several cafes during the pandemic, where he was astonished to see low footfall during the day at key cafes &amp; hotel across UAE. JC understood that the greying office cubicle isnâ€™t ideal grounds for a productive, engaged or happy working. <br><br> <strong>WorkinBuddy emerged from a basic idea and key principle to bridge the gap between restaurants &amp; members.</strong></p>
    <p>								WorkinBuddy not only provides the increased footfall in its locations, but also provides cost effective solutions to start ups, business owners, students & those workin from home during the pandemic. JC believes that coworking spaces are the future of workin where members can work productively, collaboratively and, most importantly, work happier.						</p>
